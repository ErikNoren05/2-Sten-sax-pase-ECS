# Developer Documentation for Rock-Paper-Scissors Game

## Introduction
This developer documentation provides insights into the implementation of a Rock-Paper-Scissors (RPS) game structured under the Entity Component System (ECS) paradigm. The ECS architecture is employed to enhance modularity, flexibility, and scalability within the game's design.

## Technical Specifications and Design
- **Entities:** The game revolves around two main entities, the player and the opponent, each represented as an instance of the `Entity` class.
- **Components:** The primary components include the `ChoiceComponent`, responsible for managing player and opponent choices.
- **Systems:** Two key systems are utilized: the `GameSystem`, handling player input, and the `WinnerSystem`, determining the winner based on choices made.
